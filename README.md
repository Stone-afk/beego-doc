# beego-doc

We are working on writing new docs.

Now, we have finished the Chinese version and we are still working on translating it to English.

If you are looking for old Beego doc, please check [beego.vip](http://beego.vip/)

## deploy the docs

You must install the node.js on your computer.

```go
npm run "docs:dev"
```

## Help wanted

We want someone to help us translate these docs or writing new section.

Feel free to make PR to this project!
